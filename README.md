pdfViewer
=========

Designed a pdf reader, including most features of Adobe Reader. The goal of the project was to familiarize myself with Cocoa programming and user interface design. The program is written in Objective-c using Xcode. I plan to add a few  more features to make it more of my own version-not only a replica of Adobe reader.
